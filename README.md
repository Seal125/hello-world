# hello-world
Just a place where I can store ideas, resources, or share/discuss things with others! (This is a project.)

This is where I'll be talking a bit about myself. I love technology, and I have been really excited to watch it evolve as I've gotten older. My first bit of tech was the GameBoy, a spongebob version of it. Since then, I've gotten to witness more technology than I could count, and going from 8-bit pixels to 4k HD resolution is astounding. I've ranted a bit, haven't I? Well, other than loving tech, I am more of a cat-lover than a dog-lover. I am currently preparing myself for the career of my choice, and even hoping to make a little money as I do.
